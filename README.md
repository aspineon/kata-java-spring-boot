# Java Spring Boot Kata
This is a repository for an exercise in setting up a simple Spring Boot application using Java.

## Pre-Reqs

### **Java**
Some version of Java JDK is installed
 - `java -version`

#### Option 1: Install using Brew (Uses OpenJDK)
 - `brew update`
 - `brew tap homebrew/cask-versions`
 - `brew cask install java`

#### Option 2: Install from Oracle (Uses Oracle JDK - allows for licensing Long Term Support)
   - [Java 8 (LTS)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
   - [Java 11 (LTS)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html)

 Note: [Oracle JDK Licensing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22358071/differences-between-oracle-jdk-and-openjdk)
 ```
Starting with JDK 11 accessing the long time support Oracle JDK/Java SE will now require a commercial license. You should now pay attention to which JDK you're installing as Oracle JDK without subscription could stop working.
